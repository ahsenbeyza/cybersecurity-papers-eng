#### 	Project: Microsoft Security Copilot for Incident Response 
> Example: Microsoft Security Copilot helps automate the process of dealing with cyberattacks. It can quickly respond to incidents by isolating the problem, providing the necessary information to fix it, and restoring systems to normal. This saves time and effort for security teams.

####  Project: Microsoft Security Copilot 
> Example: Microsoft Security Copilot is a tool that uses AI to help keep your network safe. It works by constantly scanning for any unusual activities or potential threats and can react immediately to stop them. This makes it easier for companies to protect their data without relying solely on human monitoring

### 2) AI for Vulnerability Management and Security Enhancement

####  Project: IBM's Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) 
> Example: IBM’s ART is a toolkit designed to protect AI systems from attacks. It helps make AI models more secure by defending against threats like data poisoning or hacking attempts that target AI weaknesses.

####  Project: TensorFlow Privacy 
>Example: TensorFlow Privacy is an extension of the TensorFlow platform that ensures AI models are trained with privacy protections. This makes the AI systems less vulnerable to being exploited or manipulated by attackers.

####  Project: OWASP ZAP with Machine Learning 
>Example: OWASP ZAP is a tool that tests web applications for security flaws. By adding machine learning, it can automate the process and become more effective at finding issues like SQL injections or cross-site scripting (XSS).

####  Project: HackerOne with AI-Enhanced Scanning 
>Example: HackerOne is a platform where security researchers find bugs in software. It uses AI to help automate the search for vulnerabilities, making it faster and easier to discover weaknesses in applications.

####  Project: GitHub Copilot and CodeQL 
> Example: GitHub Copilot is an AI tool that helps developers write code. When used with CodeQL, it also scans for security issues in the code as it's being written, helping catch problems early before they become serious.

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67a32ce9-ce35-48ce-af67-d43a44d5c877">

#### Project: SonarQube with AI Plugins 
> Example: SonarQube is a tool for checking the quality and security of code. With AI plugins, it gets even better at finding vulnerabilities and reduces the number of false alarms, making it easier for developers to fix real issues.

#### Project: IBM’s Guardium for Patch Management 
> Example: IBM’s Guardium uses AI to keep your data safe by finding and fixing vulnerabilities in both on-premises and cloud environments. It adapts to new threats and helps ensure that your data is protected by applying necessary patches on time.

#### Project: Tenable’s Exposure AI 
> Example: Tenable’s Exposure AI helps identify and fix weak spots in your system before hackers can exploit them. It uses AI to scan for vulnerabilities, prioritize which ones are most critical, and ensure they are patched quickly, making your system more secure.

#### Project: Zscaler Data Protection 
>Example: Zscaler Data Protection uses AI to safeguard sensitive information by scanning documents, emails, and images. It classifies data, detects unauthorized access, and prevents data breaches, making it easier to manage and protect sensitive information.


### 3) AI for Identity and Access Management

#### Project: IBM Verify 
> Example: IBM Verify uses AI to enhance identity and access management by analyzing user behavior and adjusting authentication requirements. It can detect anomalies and automatically enforce multi-factor authentication, improving security while simplifying user access management.
